Project Description:
The goal of this project was to sort a list of random numbers given a range from the user, the total number 
of random numbers they want to be sorted, and their choice of using either the ‘Selection’ or ‘Insertion’ sorting algorithm. 
The random numbers generated will then be sorted using the sorting algorithm chosen by the user, and stored in an output file 
named by the user that will show the sorted list. 

Catherine:
Created a branch called Sort to store the sorting files and merged the pull request.

Traci:
Created a branch called randnum to store the random number generator file, and updated the ReadMe file. 

Ricardo:
Updated every file and merged the branches together.
